    You can always opt-in by running "amplify configure --share-project-config-on"
âœ… Initialized your environment successfully.
âœ… Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!
Some next steps:

"amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
"amplify add <category>" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
"amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
"amplify console" to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
"amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud


Pro tip:
Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify push" to deploy everything
